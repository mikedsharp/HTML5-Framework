JS Naming Convention. 03-May-2014

NB: I've created this document for my own personal santity, I have a habit of forgetting the naming convention I'm sticking
to in JavaScript since there doesn't seem to be one, single agreed standard on this matter. 

The standard is as follows 

modules/namespaces : lowercase, one word. 
module/namespace filenames: one new word (the module name) will be appended to the file name in lower case, each module part will be separated by a dot (.) 
classes: CamelCase 
methods (any kind of method) : mixedCase
local and public vars: mixedCase
private vars and private methods: _mixedCase
constants: UPPERCASE 
enumerations: the enumeration 'class' will be treated as such, so it will be CamelCase, the variables inside will be treated as constants, so UPPERCASE

If anything else pops into my head, I will update this doc.
